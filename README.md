# 2131J 2022-2023 Robotics Code
 
Competition code for the 2022-2023 VEX Robotics Competition

Has driver-control, autonomous control, as well as a PID system.

Used Vexcode V5 Pro to write it. Didn't use the PROS extension via visual studio.
Note no version history here. I used a different private repository when I was actually competing.

A lot of the code in here makes not too much sense without the context of the robot (imagine a robot with a wheel-based drivetrain that can pick up little frisbees from the ground and shoot them from a catapult system into a frisbee-golf type of goal)
