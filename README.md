# 2131J 2022-2023 Robotics Code
 
Competition code for the 2022-2023 VEX Robotics Competition

Has driver-control, autonomous control, as well as a PID system.

Used Vexcode V5 Pro to write it. Didn't use the PROS extension via visual studio.
Note no version history here. I used a different private repository when I was actually competing.
